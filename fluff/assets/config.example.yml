# These comments are here to get you started,
# and will go away upon setting the configuration
# for the first time. You can see these comments
# again by using the "configs stock" command.

# For any setting asking for an ID, you can put
# the name of it as well, and the bot will be able
# to use it just fine. Note that it will use the
# first one it finds, and it is case-sensitive.
# For example:
# modrole: "Staff"
# Will work like:
# modrole: 259199371361517569

staff:
  # The role ID for your admin role.
  adminrole: 
  # The role ID for your moderator role.
  modrole: 
  # The role ID for bots. This will allow bots to speak during lockdowns, and in mute channels.
  botrole: 
  # The channel ID for the Staff channel.
  staffchannel: 
  # A link to your rules. You can use channels with "<#CHANNELID>",
  # but the bot will not convert a name for you.
  rulesurl: 
  # A link to appeal bans or actions. This will be forwarded to
  # the user upon being banned by the bot.
  appealurl: 

mute:
  # The role ID to add to users when muting a user.
  muterole: 
  # The category ID for mute sessions to be created in.
  mutecategory: 
  # The channel that the bot will send its mute notifications to.
  # If left blank, the bot will use the Staff channel instead.
  notificationchannel: 
  # The channel names that the bot will use when creating sessions.
  # You may only have up to 25.
  mutechannels:

  # The topic for each muted channel.
